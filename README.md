# autograph


## What is autograph?

Autograph lets you use graphql to load data. 

## Ways to use Autograph:

- React Suspense (suspend rendering until data loaded / loading placeholder boundaries)
- NextJS (server side isomorphic rendering)
- React Render Prop (show placeholder until data is loaded)
- React Higher Order Component (wrap a component so that it is passed Query as a prop)


## How autograph works

React works by first rendering to a virtual dom, figuring out which elements need to be created and updated, and applying the appropriate changes to the DOM. Autograph essentially makes use of a virtual virtual dom— a cursory rendering pass where it tries to figure out what pieces of data your app needs to render. From this it automatically generates a GraphQL query that fetches only the data that your app needs and nothing more. 

If you use typescript, you can import the type definitions generated by Autograph and have typescript statically ensure that all of your rendering code is compliant with your graphql schema. 

## Browser Compatibility

Autograph supports all browsers that React supports (IE9+).
