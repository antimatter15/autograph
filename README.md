# autograph


Ways to use Autograph:

- React Suspense (suspend rendering until data loaded / loading placeholder boundaries)
- NextJS (server side isomorphic rendering)
- React Render Prop (show placeholder until data is loaded)
- React Higher Order Component (wrap a component so that it is passed Query as a prop)
